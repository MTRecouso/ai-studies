Projects for the Artificial Intelligence subject of Fatec Rubens Lara. Currently being written in Javascript, but may include other languages in the future.

# Pseudo-perceptron with step function

First project for the subject. The objective is to use the step function to simulate various logic gates. There is no machine learning in this initial exercise.
