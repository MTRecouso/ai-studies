# ai-studies
Projects for the Artificial Intelligence subject of Fatec Rubens Lara. Currently being written in Javascript, but may include other languages in the future.

# Pseudo-perceptron with step function

First project for the subject. The objective is to use the step function to simulate various logic gates. There is no machine learning in this initial exercise.

File: step_function.js

# Perceptron with step function

Project of a Perceptron which recieves a pair of test grades and learns to evaluate which pairs represent an improvement or stagnation (2nd grade >= 1st grade) and which represent an decline (2nd grade < 1st grade).

File: grade_perceptron.js

# Adaline Perceptron

Project of a Adaline Perceptron which recieves three functions(signals) and learns how to create an linear combination of them. A chart created using Chart.js shows the result signal compared to the correct linear combination. That perceptron is also used to make the linear combination of two other sets of functions and show it on a chart.
